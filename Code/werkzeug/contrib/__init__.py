    `werkzeug.contrib`
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Contains user-submitted code that other users may find useful,
    but which are not part of Werkzeug core. Anyone can write
    code for inclusion in the `contrib` package.  All the modules
    in this package are distributed as an addon library and thus not
    part of `werkzeug` itself.

    This file itself is mostly for informational purposes and to
    tell the Python interpreter that `contrib` is a package.
